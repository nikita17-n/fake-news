# Fake News Detection Web App 📰

A machine learning web application that predicts whether a news article is Real or Fake using a trained ML model.

## Live Demo
(Will be added after deployment)

## Features
- Accepts raw news text as input
- Uses a pre-trained machine learning model for prediction
- Provides instant and clear results
- No retraining required during runtime

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Streamlit
- Joblib

## How It Works
1. User enters a news article
2. Text is transformed using a saved TF-IDF vectorizer
3. Trained model predicts whether the news is real or fake
4. Result is displayed on the web interface

## Run Locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
